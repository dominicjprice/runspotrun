      We are a group of researchers from the University of Nottingham conducting a research
      project that has been funded by a grant from Google/YouTube investigating the capture
      of spectator videos of a marathon.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are investigating how spectators can capture video coverage of runners, and subsequently
      create online experiences that can document the individual runner's race.
    </p>
