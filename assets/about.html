    <h1>What is it for?</h1>
    <p>
      RunSpotRun is a new application that attempts to crowd-source video
      footage of marathons and running races. We want you to join the crowd
      of spectators filming these events with your Android phone, so we can
      tell the stories of the thousands of amateur and charity runners who
      are taking part.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use RunSpotRun to record videos of the marathon as you spectate.
      However, we also want you to <strong>spot</strong> runners as they stream past, by tapping
      in their number. You can also <strong>spot</strong> things that you just think are 
      interesting happening in the race by tapping the <strong>hotspot</strong> button.
    </p>
    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
    <p>
      When you <strong>spot</strong> a runner, RunSpotRun records the time and location of the spot.
      If enough spectators <strong>spot</strong> the same runner over the course of the race, we can
      automatically create a montage video of them as they run around the course. 
      The more <strong>spots</strong> you make, the better the story we can tell of the runner will be.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you record a video it stays on your phone, so we'll need you to upload your
      videos after the event. By default RunSpotRun will only upload video when you're
      on WiFi, so we won't eat into your data allowance.
    </p>
    <h1>So what do I do?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Head to the marathon and pick your prime spectating spot.</li>
      <li>Start <strong>videoing</strong> and <strong>spotting</strong> runners!</li>
      <li>When you get home make sure to upload your videos</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We'll review all of the videos (to make sure you haven't accidentally spotted
      something you shouldn't), then you'll be able to log onto runspotrun.co.uk
      and check out the videos of your friends and family taken by the crowd of
      spotters around the course.
